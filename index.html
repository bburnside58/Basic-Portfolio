			<p>Hello! Born in Tampa, Fl. University of Central Florida alumni. I like to take long walks on the beach, watching the sunset, and poking dead things with a stick. I am currently enrolled in UCF coding bootcamp and it's pretty gnar-kill so far, brah. The first assignment did have like, whoah bro but, I figured out that "." is for classes and "#" is for id's. I was so lost on that one. Had no clue. Must'a missed that one, thought it was whatevs and all. Flipidy-Flopidy but, nah can't do that. So many hours wasted on dat one. Anywho, I figured that one out like a boss and went from 0 to one hundred real quick. Well, more like 83.4 but, that is exponential growth according to my math.</p>
